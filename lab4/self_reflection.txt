All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The resize method take one integer parameter to represent resize up or down.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: The resize method, adds and removes method.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: Convert special cases to general case, decrease the repeat of my code.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Make helper function to reduce redundant code in adds and removes method, rewrite resize method in a better way. (Actually already rewrite it.)

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I think it's one of the simplest code.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: None.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Maybe some "this" keyword is redundant and I will delete it.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Yes. I can learn something I didn't know before and improve my code skill and thinking.
